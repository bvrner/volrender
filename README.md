# Volume Renderer

A simple OpenGL renderer for volumetric data written in C++17.

This is in very early stages of development, and probably will remain as such, given that I'm writing it while learning about volume rendering for the first time, so don't even try to load some huge data set or expect that it will compile and work of the bat.
